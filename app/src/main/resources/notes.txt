TODO: 
- add all boundary matchers to grammar (some were forgotten)
- check all tokens are used in grammar rules


Feature Notes:
- ^a$bc$ cannot match anything but the parser parses it so must add some error detection
- for lookaheads, treat them differently when traversing the AST so what they reference is clear
- for double boundary matchers add a special case when traversing the AST
UI Notes:
- things to group top down
    - quote
    - zeroWidthAssertions
    - inlineModifier
    - captureGroup 
    - group

    - wordBoundary
    - nonWordBoundary 
    - inputStart 
    - endOfMatch 
    - letter
    - quantifier 
    - boundaryMatcherEnd
    - endOfInputExceptFinalTerminator
    - endOfInput
    - or

Referencing Other Atoms:
Use inheritance: 
    - eg. boundary matcher extends atom and has extra instance variables to store what it bounds
    - eg. quantifiers extends atom and has extra instance variables to store what it quantifies

Types of Atoms that Reference Other Atoms: 
- Boundary matchers
- Quantifiers
- Or 
- capturing groups 
- Special constructs (named-capturing and non-capturing)
    - (?<name>X)	X, as a named-capturing group
    - (?:X)	X, as a non-capturing group
    - (?idmsuxU-idmsuxU) 	Nothing, but turns match flags i d m s u x U on - off
    - (?idmsux-idmsux:X)  	X, as a non-capturing group with the given flags i d m s u x on - off
    - (?=X)	X, via zero-width positive lookahead
    - (?!X)	X, via zero-width negative lookahead
    - (?<=X)	X, via zero-width positive lookbehind
    - (?<!X)	X, via zero-width negative lookbehind
    - (?>X)	X, as an independent, non-capturing group
